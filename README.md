Project Description: Web scraping, Crawling automated with Python - Implentation Stats,

Problem: Company X have many banks as customers, Company x wants to find out, how many of their customers
have implemented loan calculators and or videos on their websites, and they want to monitor once a month, to see how it progresses

We want to build an automated crawler and scraper, that looks for values in different websites.

We will implement 3 databases in Google's Big Query
1. A list of databases to crawl.
2. A list of values to look for on each website we crawl
3. Response table where we insert what we found and where.


Last but not least we will implement graphs etc. on Google DataStudio, so that company x can monitor through Google DataStudio chart we will share with them.
