Project Description: Hand digit recognizer

Problem: We want to create an AI tool that can recognize any image of a handwritten digit, fed into the system.

BonusProblem: Feed an image of letters, and be able to read the handwritten image.

Our task is to first provide a sample data so that our AI can learn from this sample data, and then we want a test data, that we can test with and see the accuracy.
